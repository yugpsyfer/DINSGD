# Communication Compressed Normalized SGD
## Implementation of the paper Oracle Complexity of Nonsmooth Nonconvex Distributed Stochastic Optimization

Make sure wandb is installed refer here -> *https://wandb.ai/*

#To train the model follow these steps:
- Make sure CUDA device is available.
- Select the optimizer to be used from [DINSGD, SGD, ADAM].
- execute `python3 main.py`
